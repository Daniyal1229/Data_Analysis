# Data_Analysis
The zombie virus data analysis project seeks to investigate and analyse a particular dataset in order to acquire insight into the virus's features and propagation. Data cleansing, exploration, and visualisation are all part of the analysis to uncover patterns and trends in the data. The study also includes statistical modelling to investigate the correlations between various variables and estimate the virus's possible impact. The findings of the study can be utilised to drive policy choices and public health measures aimed at slowing the spread and impact of the zombie virus.
